==============
You need a LaTeX distribution installed
and Asymptote from https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/
==============

If you have a complete (full) TeXLive distribution,
it already includes Asymptote by default.

==============
setup.asy contains all the styling and templates,
it can be changed to create a more complex style.

==============
Edit slides.asy to create slides with text, formulas or pictures.
==============

Text can be included in separate files. It can include LaTeX code and line breaks.

Pictures can be in .png, .pdf or .eps formats.
You can exactly control their placement as seen in the example.
Coordinates are measured in cm, the slide is 16cm x 9cm.

==============
To create .pdf presentation, run the glue script.
==============

glue.bat is for Windows
glue.sh for Linux
